# InsertionSort
command line program demonstrating the insertion sort

## Description
Sometimes it's difficult to visualize how sorting algorithms work. This program makes a random array of ints with user-defined array length, and color-coded the sorted area on left to show how algorithm inserts next value from unsorted area on right into the sorted area.
